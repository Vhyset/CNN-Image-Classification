# CNN-Image-Classification
Classification on playing card images using a Convolutional Neural Network

### By: Alex B Tucker
--------------------

This project takes a labeled dataset of playing card images from multiple decks, and attempts to classify them based on both value and suit.

~7600 training data / ~300 testing data / 53 classes

The dataset was found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification

Download the dataset from Kaggle before running the script.

A homemade CNN model using Keras was used. The validation accuracy is around 83 percent.

Also, a transfer learning model using ResNet101 was used.

In another repository on my profile, you may find this dataset addressed using traditional ML methods.
